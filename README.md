# ballcollisions
Program made by Joshua carpenter-Jones

Hope you enjoy!

Issues:

-Balls fuse together. 

-Balls seem to act strange around the edges.

-I've used a one dimensional collision equation in order to create the physics of ball collisions. Going to make it 2-D soon. Not sure if it'll mae a difference


Notes:
Make sure you don't use the program while chromes running, otherwise it will lag. Thank you!

Update 1.1: (17/04/2019)

-I've enabled mass so that when high mass particles bump into low mass ones, the velocity of the low mass ball is increased. This makes the simulation look a lot better

-Fixed the 'fusion' bug although it still occurs rarely

-Balls move about randomly initially. Unlike before
