# ballcollisions
Program made by Joshua carpenter-Jones

Hope you enjoy! :)

Issues:

Balls fuse together. 

Balls seem to act strange around the edges.

I've used a one dimensional collision equation in order to create the physics of ball collisions. Going to make it 2-D soon. Not sure if it'll mae a difference
Notes:
Make sure you don't use the program while chromes running, otherwise it will lag. Thank you!
